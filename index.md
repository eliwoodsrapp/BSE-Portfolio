# Ball-Tracking Robot
This Raspberry Pi-powered robot uses a camera module to detect and approach a ball. The trick is in the color: the Raspberry Pi isolates the color of the ball, making identification much more simple.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  
For my first milestone, I tested the camera module with a color-filter. First, I set up my Raspberry Pi. I uploaded an OS for the Pi to a micro SD, and plugged it into the board. Then, I downloaded PuTTY and VNC Viewer to interact with the Pi through my laptop. Once I could access the Pi, I installed necessary camera packages to be able to use the camera module, then I installed OpenCV for the capability of color-filtering. I plugged in the camera module, and set to writing some test code. The completed code provided three displays, a preview of the raw camera stream, that same camera stream with the color red isolated as white, and finally, the camera stream with the color red isolated as red. It encouraged me, because the test showed a major part of the completed prototype in a functional state.
